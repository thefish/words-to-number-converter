Originally was used to minimize postal addresses written in English, like this:

```
    'Taganskaya str. thirty two, three hundred fifty six' => 'Taganskaya str. 32, 356',
    'Lenina str 56/17 b. one hundred seven' => 'Lenina str 56/17 b. 107',
    'Paris & Hilton road, twenty two, house 356' => 'Paris & Hilton road, 22, house 356',
    'Vienna, Wilhelmstrasse two hundred and thirty seven' => 'Vienna, Wilhelmstrasse 237',
```
